step1. Start the program.
step2. Prompt the user to enter the height.
step3. Read and store the height value.
step4. Check if the height is less than 1.
step5. If it is, display an error message and terminate the program.
step6. Check if the height is even.
step7. If it is, increment the height by 1.
step8. Start a loop from 0 to the height.
step9. Within the loop, start another loop from 0 to the height.
step10. Check if the current position satisfies the conditions for printing a number.
step11. If it does, check which half of the pattern we are in.
step12. If we are in the first half, calculate and print the appropriate number.
step13. If we are in the second half, calculate and print the appropriate number.
step14. If the current position does not satisfy the conditions, print three spaces.
step15. Move to the next position in the inner loop.
step16. Move to the next line in the outer loop.
step17. Repeat steps 9-16 until all positions in the pattern have been printed.
step18. End the program.
