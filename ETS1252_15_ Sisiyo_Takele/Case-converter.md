A.)Problem Analysis: The problem is to develop a program that takes a single character input from the user and converts it to its uppercase and lowercase equivalents. The program should handle both scenarios where the user enters a valid letter and where they input a character that is not a letter.

Input:

The program expects the user to input a single character.

Validation:

It needs to validate whether the entered character is a letter or not. If the input is a letter, the program proceeds with the conversion; otherwise, it prompts the user to input a valid letter.

Conversion:

If the input character is a letter, the program uses the toupper() and tolower() functions to convert the letter to its uppercase and lowercase equivalents, respectively.

Output:

The program then displays the uppercase and lowercase equivalents of the entered character.

Error Handling:

The program needs to handle scenarios where the user inputs a character that is not a letter. In such cases, it should provide an error message indicating that the user needs to input a valid letter.

User Interaction:

The program should have user-friendly prompts and messages to guide the user through the process of entering a character and understanding the output.

Program Termination:

After displaying the uppercase and lowercase equivalents or an error message, the program shou
