A.) Problem Analysis:

The problem requires designing an algorithm and a program to calculate an employee's gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment based on the provided information: employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary. Additionally, the problem hints at considering a pension rate of -5% and a tax rate of 15%. Here's the analysis:

Input:

Employee name: String input.
Weekly working hours: Numeric input (hours worked per week).
Bonus rate per hour: Numeric input (additional pay rate per hour worked).
Base salary: Numeric input (fixed salary amount).
Calculations:

Calculate the gross salary:
Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)
Calculate the pension deduction:
Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05 (5% deduction)
Calculate the net salary:
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - (Gross Salary * 0.15) (15% tax deduction)
Calculate the bonus payment:
Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour
Output:

Display the employee's name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.
B.) Algorithm Design:

Start
Input employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary.
Calculate gross salary:
Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)
Calculate pension deduction:
Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05
Calculate tax deduction:
Tax Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.15
Calculate net salary:
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - Tax Deduction
Calculate bonus payment:
Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour
Display employee name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.
