A.) Problem Analysis: The problem requires designing an algorithm and a program to calculate an employee's gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment based on the provided information: employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary. Additionally, the problem hints at considering a pension rate of -5% and a tax rate of 15%. Here's the analysis:

Input:

Employee name: String input.
Weekly working hours: Numeric input (hours worked per week).
Bonus rate per hour: Numeric input (additional pay rate per hour worked).
Base salary: Numeric input (fixed salary amount).
Calculations:

Calculate the gross salary:
Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)
Calculate the pension deduction:
Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05 (5% deduction)
Calculate the net salary:
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - (Gross Salary * 0.15) (15% tax deduction)
Calculate the bonus payment:
Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour
Output:

Display the employee's name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.
B.) Algorithm Design:

Start

Input employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary.

Calculate gross salary:

Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)
Calculate pension deduction:

Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05
Calculate tax deduction:

Tax Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.15
Calculate net salary:

Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - Tax Deduction
Calculate bonus payment:

Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour
Display employee name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.

End Pseudocode: START

INPUT employeeName (Prompt for employee's name)

INPUT weeklyWorkingHours (Prompt for weekly working hours)

INPUT bonusRatePerHour (Prompt for bonus rate per hour)

INPUT baseSalary (Prompt for base salary)

SET grossSalary = baseSalary + (weeklyWorkingHours * bonusRatePerHour)

SET pensionDeduction = grossSalary * 0.05 (5% pension deduction)

SET taxDeduction = grossSalary * 0.15 (15% tax deduction)

SET netSalary = grossSalary - pensionDeduction - taxDeduction

SET bonusPayment = weeklyWorkingHours * bonusRatePerHour

DISPLAY "Employee Name: employeeName"

DISPLAY "Gross Salary: grossSalary"

DISPLAY "Net Salary: netSalary"

DISPLAY "Bonus Payment: bonusPayment"
