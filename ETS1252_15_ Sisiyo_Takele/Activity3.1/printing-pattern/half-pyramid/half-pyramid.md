  # Problem Analysis:

Input: The program requests the number of rows ("row") from the user.
Logic:
     Two nested loops are used to determine the pattern.
     The outer loop iterates "row" times, controlling the number of rows in the triangle.
     The inner loop iterates "j" times, where "j" is less than or equal to the current row number ("i"). This controls the number of asterisks printed in each row.
     Each iteration of the inner loop prints an asterisk followed by a space.
Output: The program prints the resulting right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks to the console.
