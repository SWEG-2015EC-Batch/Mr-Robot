  # Problem Analysis:

This C++ code still prompts the user for the number of rows (rows).
However, the nested loops now construct a right-angled triangle pattern of numbers:
The outer loop still iterates for each row from 1 to rows.
The inner loop now iterates from 1 to the current row number i, not the total number of rows. This means each row has fewer numbers printed than the previous one, creating the triangular shape.
Within the inner loop, the current column number (j) is printed followed by a space.
After printing each row, a newline is added to move to the next line.
Output: The program prints a right-angled triangle where each row contains numbers from 1 to its own row number, decreasing in width with each successive row.
  # Pseudocode:

Start
Prompt user: Enter the number of rows (rows)
Outer loop: For each row i from 1 to row
Inner loop: For each column j from 1 to i
Print the current column number j and a space
Print a newline
End outer loop
Stop
