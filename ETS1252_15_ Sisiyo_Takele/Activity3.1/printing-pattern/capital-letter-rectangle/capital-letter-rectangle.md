  # Problem Analysis:


Input:
The program prompts the user to enter the desired number of rows (row).
The program then prompts for the desired number of columns (column).
Logic:
Two nested loops are used to iterate through the grid dimensions:
Outer loop: This loop iterates row times, controlling the number of rows printed.
Inner loop: This loop iterates column times within each outer loop iteration, controlling the number of letters printed in each row.
Inside the inner loop:
The program uses an internal counter k starting at 1.
It converts the counter k to an uppercase letter code using char(64 + k). This adds 64 to k because the ASCII code for 'A' is 65.
The letter is then printed followed by a space.
After printing each letter, k is incremented to prepare for the next iteration.
After each row iteration, the program prints a newline to move to the next line.
Output: The program prints a rectangular grid of uppercase letters, with rows increasing in alphabetical order from left to right and columns increasing in alphabetical order from top to bottom.
   # Pseudocode:
Prompt user: Enter the number of rows (row).
Prompt user: Enter the number of columns (column).
Initialize: Set a counter k to 1.
Outer loop: For each row i from 1 to row
Inner loop: For each column j from 1 to column
Convert k to uppercase letter code: char(64 + k)
Print the letter and a space
Increment k by 1
Print a newline
End outer loop
Stop
