A.) Problem Analysis: The problem requires creating a program that calculates the result of the expression x^y, where the values of x and y are provided by the user. Below is the problem analysis in detail:

Input:

Prompt the user to enter the value of x.
Prompt the user to enter the value of y.
Read and store the values entered by the user into variables x and y.
Calculation:

Calculate the result of x raised to the power of y (x^y).
Use loops or built-in functions (like pow() in C++) to perform the exponentiation calculation.
Output:

Display the calculated result of x^y to the user. B.) Aligorithm Design:
Start
Prompt the user to enter the value of x.
Read and store the value entered by the user into variable x.
Prompt the user to enter the value of y.
Read and store the value entered by the user into variable y.
Calculate the result of x raised to the power of y.
Display the calculated result of x^y to the user.
End
Example:

Consider an example using the problem analysis:

**Input:

User inputs x = 2
User inputs y = 3
Output:

The result of the expression with x = 2 and y = 3 is 8 Psudocode: START
INPUT x (Prompt the user to enter the value of x)

INPUT y (Prompt the user to enter the value of y)

result = 1 (Initialize result to 1)

FOR i from 1 to y DO

result = result * x
ENDFOR

OUTPUT "Result of x^y is: result"

END
