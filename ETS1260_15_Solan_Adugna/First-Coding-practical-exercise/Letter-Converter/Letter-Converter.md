A) Problem Analysis:
The problem requires creating a program that calculates the result of the expression x^y, where the 
values of x and y are provided by the user. Below is the problem analysis in detail:
Input: Prompt the user to enter the value of x.
 : Prompt the user to enter the value of y.
Output : Calculate the result of x raised to the power of y (x^y).
Process/ Operation : Use loops or built-in functions (like pow() in C++) to perform the 
exponentiation calculation. 
B.) Algorithm Design
Pseudocode;
1 START INPUT x (Prompt the user to enter the value of x)
2 INPUT y (Prompt the user to enter the value of y)
3 result = 1 (Initialize result to 1)
4 FOR i from 1 to y DO
5 result = result * x ENDFOR
6 OUTPUT "Result of x^y is: result"
7 END
                    
                     Flowchart
