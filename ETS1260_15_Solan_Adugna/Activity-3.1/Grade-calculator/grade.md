Analysis:
This C++ program takes user inputs for various assessments (test, quiz, project, assignment, and final exam) and calculates the total marks. It then assigns a letter grade based on a specified grading scale.

Algorithm:
1. Declare variables for total marks and individual assessment components (test, quiz, project, assignment, finalexam).
2. Prompt the user to input assessment scores.
3. Calculate the total marks by summing up the individual assessment scores.
4. Check if the total marks are valid (between 0 and 100).
5. Determine the corresponding letter grade based on the specified grading scale using a series of if-else statements.
6. Output the total marks and the corresponding letter grade.
