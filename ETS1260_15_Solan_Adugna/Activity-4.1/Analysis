Analysis:

This C++ code calculates the mean and standard deviation of a set of numbers entered by the user. 
The program takes an integer n as input, representing the number of data points.
It then reads n floating-point values and calculates the mean and standard deviation based on these values.

Input:n: Number of data points.data: Floating-point values entered by the user.Variables:sum: Running sum of data points.dataSum: Sum of data points.squaredSum: Sum of the squares of data points.mean: Mean (average) of the data.sd: Standard deviation of the data.

Algorithm:

Initialize sum, dataSum, and squaredSum to zero.
Use a loop to read n data points and update dataSum and squaredSum accordingly.
Calculate the mean (mean) as the sum of data points divided by n.
Calculate the standard deviation (sd) using the formula: [ \text{sd} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{squaredSum} - \left(\frac{\text{dataSum}^2}{n}\right)}{n-1}} ]
Print the mean and standard deviation.
