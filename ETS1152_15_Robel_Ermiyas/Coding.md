1. Problem analysis
Input : weight, height
Out put: BMI
Operation: BMI = weight/(height*height)

Algorithm Design

Step 1 start
Step 2 read weight, height
Step 3 BMI = weight/(height*hight)
step 4 print BMI
Step 5 : stop

2. Problem solving
Input :  tank capacity, miles per gallon
Output : u can drive miles on a tank
Operation :  miles on a tank = tank capacity*miles per gallon

Algorithm design 
Step1 start 
Step 2 read tank capacity, miles per gallon 
Step 3 miles on a tank = tank capacity*miles per gallon 

Step 4 print miles on a tank

Step 5 stop

Logic:
The difference between the first character of uppercase and ASCII code of lower case character is 32, We add 32 to upper case letters in order to convert them to lower case, and we subtract 32 from lower case letters to convert them to upper case.
Algorithm to convert uppercase to lowercase:
Check if the character is between A and Z i.e. it is a capital letter,
If the character is a capital, we add 32 to it.
Else, the character is already in lower case. Do nothing.
Algorithm for lowercase to uppercase:
Check if the character is between ‘a’ and ‘z’ i.e. it is a lower case letter.
If the character is a lower case letter, we subtract 32 from it.
Else, the character is already in upper case. Do nothing.

4. Input : x,y(numbers)
Output : real number
Opertaion : pow(x,y)

Algorithm design
step 1 start
Step 2  read x,y
Step 3 print pow(x,y)
Step 4 stop
