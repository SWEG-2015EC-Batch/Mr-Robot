2.  Miles on a Full Tank Calculator
Algorithm Design(Pseudocode)
•  Step 1: Start
•  Step 2: Read fuel tank Capacity
•  Step 3: Read fuel consumption
•  Step 4: Compute Miles on full Tank = fuel consumption*fuel tank capacity
•  Step 5: Print Miles on full tank
•  Step 6: Stop
Problem Analysis
•  Input = Fuel tank capacity, Fuel consumption
•  Processing = Miles_on_Full_Tank = Fuel_Consumption*Fuel_Capacity
•  Output = Miles_on_Full_Tank
3.  Uppercase/Lowercase Letter Convertor
Algorithm Design(Pseudocode)
•  Step 1: Start
•  Step 2: Read Letter
•  Step 3: If Letter is uppercase go to Step 6 else if skip Step 4,6 else, skip Step 5.6.7
•  Step 4: Print the “Character Letter is not a Letter”
•  Step 5: Compute toupper(Letter)
•  Step 6: Compute tolower(Letter)
•  Step 7: Print Letter
•  Step 8: Stop
Problem Analysis
•  Input = Letter
•  Processing = if islower(Letter) Letter = toupper(Letter) else if, is upper(Letter) Letter tolower(Letter) else Letter = is not a Letter
•  Output = Letter

4.  Power Function Calculator
Algorithm Design(Pseudocode)
•  Step 1: Start
•  Step 2: Read X, Y
•  Step 3: Compute Z = pow(X,Y)
•  Step 4: Print Z

5.  Gross Salary, Net Salary & Bonus Payment Calculator
Algorithm Design(Pseudocode)
•  Step 1: Start
•  Step 2: Read Employee First_Name, Employee Fathers Name, Base Salary, Weekly Working Hours, Bonus Rate per Hour
•  Step 3: Compute Bonus_Payment = Weekly Working Hours*Bonus Rate per Hour
•  Step 4: Compute Gross_Salary = Base_Salary + Bonus_Payment
•  Step 5: Compute Net_Salary = Gross_Salary – (0.2*Gross_Salary)
•  Step 6: Print Employee First_Name,  Employee Fathers_Name, ”your Bonus Payment  
      is”, Bonus Payment,  “your Gross Salary is” Gross_Salary, “your Net Salary is”  
      Net_Salary                      

Problem Analysis
•  Input: Read Employee_First_Name, Employee_Fathers_Name, Base_Salary, Weekly_Working_Hours, Bonus_Rate_per_Hour
•  Processing: Compute Bonus Payment =Weekly_Working_Hours*Bonus_Rate_per_Hour, Compute Gross_Salary = Base_Salary + (Weekly_Working_Hours*Bonus_Rate_per_ Hour), Compute Net_Salary = Gross_Salary – (0.2*Gross_Salary)
•  Output: Employee_First_Name, Employee_Fathers_Name, Bonus_Payment, Gross_Salary, Net_Salary

6.  File Transmission ETA Calculator
Algorithm Design(Pseudocode)
•  Step 1: Start
•  Step 2: Read File Size in Bytes
•  Step 3: Compute Time for Transmission = File Size in Bytes/960
