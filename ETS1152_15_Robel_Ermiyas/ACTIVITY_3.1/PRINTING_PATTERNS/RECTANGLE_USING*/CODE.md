Problem Description:
1,Problem Discription
Program to draw rectangle with continous letter

2,Program Analysis
Input
row , column
process
use loop for row and column
Output
rectangle with letter

Algorithm Design:
1. Start
2. Use two nested for loops to iterate through each row and column of the rectangle.
3. In the outer for loop, iterate from 1 to 5 to represent each row.
4. In the inner for loop, iterate from 1 to 10 to represent each column.
5. Inside the inner for loop, print the '*' character followed by a space to represent the rectangle pattern.
6. After printing all the '*' characters in a row, move to the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all rows and columns are printed.
8. End
