1. Problem Description:

    -The given C++ code calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a set of numbers without using an array. The program prompts the user to enter the 
   number of elements and then proceeds to take input of those numbers. It calculates the mean by summing up the entered numbers and dividing the sum by the total 
   number of elements. It then calculates the variance by summing up the squared differences between each number and the mean, and divides it by the total number of 
   elements. Finally, it calculates the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance. The program outputs the input numbers, mean, and standard 
   deviation.

2. Problem analysis:

input:

   - numbers

output:

   -mean
   -standard devaition
   -variance

procsess:

   -read numbers
   -compute mean, standard devaition and variance using loops based on thier formulas.
