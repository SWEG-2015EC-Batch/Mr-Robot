              Code Description

The code generates a pattern using nested loops and conditional statements 
based on the user-input height, creating a symmetric shape with calculated 
numbers. The conditional statements control the placement and values of the 
printed numbers.
  
      PSEUDOCODE
  step 1. Start the program.

  step 2. Prompt the user to enter the height.
  
  step 3. Read and store the height value.
 
  step 4. Check if the height is less than 1.
 
  step 5. If it is, display an error message and terminate the program.

  step 6. Check if the height is even.
 
  step 7. If it is, increment the height by 1.

  step 8. Start a loop from 0 to the height.

  step 9. Within the loop, start another loop from 0 to the height.
  
  step 10. Check if the current position satisfies the conditions for printing a number.
  
  step 11. If it does, check which half of the pattern we are in.
  
  step 12. If we are in the first half, calculate and print the appropriate number.
  
  step 13. If we are in the second half, calculate and print the appropriate number.
  
  step 14. If the current position does not satisfy the conditions, print three spaces.
  
  step 15. Move to the next position in the inner loop.
  
  step 16. Move to the next line in the outer loop.
  
  step 17. Repeat steps 9-16 until all positions in the pattern have been printed.

  step 18. End the program.
